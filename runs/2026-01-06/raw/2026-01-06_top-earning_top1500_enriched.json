Some will observe from a safe distance, while others will risk it all to get the perfect shot of a violent tornado from close range. Whether you're out there deploying data-collecting probes, intercepting in an armored vehicle, or just taking pictures, you're bound to have a run in with mother nature like no other. Just watch yourself, sometimes the hunters become the hunted. \n\nConnect with us through our social links (below this), where you can talk to others about the game, view change logs, announcements, and make suggestions.\n\nDevelopers:\nWillzuh - Builder\nSiryzm - Programmer\n\nSpecial thanks to our contributors for making this possible!",
